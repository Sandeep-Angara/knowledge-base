# Power Platform ALM

With App Life Cycle Management, you can eaily manage solutions between different environments, say it Development, Testing, and Production. To automate ALM process, we have pipelines in Azue DevOps. With that we can build pipelines that extracts solution from one environment, track changes in repository and finally moves solution to target environments (Test / Production). For setting up pipelines and to implement ALM, we need to perform different configurations and setup.

- [x] Azure DevOps- Setting up Organization, Project, Repository, and permissions in Project Settings
- [x] Azure App registration
- [x] Service Connections
